    "text": "Recapping this year\nThe ASI Board of Directors at Cal Poly is considered the official voice of the student body. The role of a Director is two-fold. I‚Äôm proud to share some of the work I accomplished this year on both ends of the role.\n\nAdvocate\nIn terms of political advocacy, we are the voices who represent our student constituents. One thing that I‚Äôm passionate about is student wellness, particularly with respect to mental health. I worked with, Emily, the Secretary of Health and Wellbeing this year on policy that aims to recognize mental health as an excusable reason for absence, with appropriate documentation. Our resolution passed the board unanimously and was referred to the Cal Poly President Armstrong as well as other campus officials.\n\n\nFiduciary\nDirectors are also responsible for the internal corporate business like budget approvals and strategic planning.\nThis year, I was appointed to Co-Chair the Internal Review Committee. This is one of two corporate committees within ASI and it‚Äôs role is more stipulated by mandates. Internal Review oversees risk management and serves as the corporation‚Äôs audit committee.\nIn the fall, the Board of Directors approved an ad hoc committee to conduct a comprehensive bylaw review. I helped incorporate a nonprofit in 2022, which entailed writing some bylaws, so I was appointed to chair this committee as well.\nThe committee was composed of all three of the corporation‚Äôs officers, plus three additional student leaders in student government. This meant six confident voices held a seat at the table and facilitating the discussion effectively would prove pertinent to our success. An unanticipated challenge, however, was push-back from other stakeholders. On a couple instances, I presented revisions made by the committee to the Board of Directors and wasn‚Äôt quite prepared for the amount of feedback. It taught me a lesson about creating a comfortable buffer between myself and my work.\nThe final bill passed the Board of Directors unanimously and the revisions we instituted will carry into future administrations of ASI indefinitely."

The Board of Directors had the privilege of hearing both Kathy and Sarah during speak during one of our recent meetings.
