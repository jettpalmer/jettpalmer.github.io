    "text": "As an elected member of the ASI Board of Directors, I made it part of my 2023 campaign to advocate for mental wellness on the Cal Poly campus. Last fall, I reached out the Secretary of Campus Health and Well-being, Emily Prince, and we began authoring legislation that would drive this mission.\n\nIt was in the midst of drafting our message and holding meetings with campus officials that the exigence of this work became clear to me. An individual who is very close to my heart faced a mental health crisis. I shed many tears, for many days, and my academics were impacted. This was beyond challenging, but the experience gave me new and ambitious passion for the work Emily and I were spearheading.\n\nResolution 24-02 of the ASI Board of Directors called upon the university Academic Senate to include mental health in the definition of illness within the Excusable Absence Policy. On February 21st of this year, the Board passed our resolution unanimously. As the official voice of the student body, the position of ASI Student Government was made clear by this legislation, and it was promptly disseminated to University President Armstrong and a number of VP‚Äôs at Cal Poly. The Academic Senate pushed the legislation forward and authored their own legislation that, if approved, would change the Excusable Absence Policy, consistent with our recommendations."

I am pleased to announce that the Academic Senate has now passed the policy, changing language on the Excusable Absence Policy to be explicitly inclusive of mental health and discouraging the requirement of a doctor‚Äôs note. This is a huge leap forward for Cal Poly students and it is my honor to be at the forefront of this action.\nI want to thank Emily Prince for your thoughtful collaboration and the Board of Directors for your passionate support. I also want to thank Dr.¬†Greenwood for your guidance in this process. The Student Health Advisory Committee stood beside us and advised our legislation. Thank you to the members of SHAC as well. Lastly, thank you to everyone who provided feedback and insight on the resolution. Your voices were heard and I hope you feel proud of the work you helped to create.\nYou can view Resolution #24-02 from the ASI Board of Directors here."

    "section": "My role",
    "text": "My role\nThe ASI Board of Directors at Cal Poly is considered the official voice of the student body. The role of a Director is two-fold. I‚Äôm proud to share some of the work I accomplished this year in both advocacy and corporate oversight.\n\nAdvocate\nIn terms of political advocacy, we are the voices who represent our student constituents. One thing that I‚Äôm passionate about is student wellness, particularly with respect to mental health. This year, I worked with our Secretary of Health and Wellbeing, Emily Prince, on policy that recognizes mental health as an excusable reason for absence. Our resolution passed the board unanimously and was referred to Cal Poly President Jeff Armstrong as well as other campus officials.\nIn response, the Academic Senate, a faculty-governed body, wrote and approved a policy change that officially amended the campus-wide excusable absence policy to include mental health. This is my proudest initiative on campus as it marks a huge step forward for our students and demonstrates value in shared governance.\n\n\nFiduciary\nDirectors are also responsible for the internal corporate business, including budget approvals and strategic planning.\nThis year, I was appointed to Co-Chair the Internal Review Committee. This is one of two corporate committees within ASI, and it‚Äôs mandated to oversee risk management and serve as the corporation‚Äôs audit committee. In the fall, the Board of Directors approved an Ad Hoc committee to conduct a comprehensive bylaw review. Having incorporated a nonprofit in 2022, I was appointed to chair this committee concurrently.\nThe committee was composed of all three ASI officers, plus three additional student leaders in student government. I knew that having six confident voices at the table meant facilitating the discussion effectively would be pertinent to our success. An unanticipated challenge, however, was push-back from other stakeholders. On a couple instances, I presented revisions made by the committee to the Board of Directors and wasn‚Äôt quite prepared for the overwhelming feedback. It taught me a lesson about creating a comfortable buffer between myself and my work.\nAfter a lengthy process of feedback loops and redrafting, the final bill passed the Board of Directors unanimously on 5/24/2024, and the revisions we instituted will carry into future administrations of ASI indefinitely."

    "text": "Recognition\nThis leads us to the end of the academic year. I advocated for policy serving the mental wellness of students and revamped our corporate bylaws. I continuously asked hard questions of campus officials and stood up to stakeholders to justify or reconsider my team‚Äôs decisions.\nSarah Storelli, former ASI Student Body President, instituted the ‚ÄúUse Your Voice‚Äù Scholarship this year on behalf of her mom, Kathy Storelli. The Board of Directors had the privilege of hearing both Kathy and Sarah during speak during one of our recent meetings. They shared beautiful words and inspiring sentiment that spoke powerfully to student government members.\nDuring our student government end-of-year banquet, I was graciously awarded this scholarship. I am beyond grateful for the support and lessons that ASI has provided me. Student government lends me a platform to spark change on campus that reaches our entire student body. It‚Äôs my mission to continue elevating student voices and maximizing my impact on campus. The Storelli family, students, and staff at ASI continue to motivate my work."
