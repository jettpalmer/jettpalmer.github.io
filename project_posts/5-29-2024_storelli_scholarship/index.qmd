## Some history

Like many, I find meaning in service work. It feels like a reliable way to maintain purpose and fulfillment, independent of career or academic achievement. After coming to Cal Poly, it wasn't long before I found myself in student government and elected to the Board of Directors for Associated Students Inc.

## Recapping this year

The ASI Board of Directors at Cal Poly is considered the official voice of the student body. The role of a Director is two-fold. I'm proud to share some of the work I accomplished this year on both ends of the role.

### Advocate

In terms of political advocacy, we are the voices who represent our student constituents. One thing that I'm passionate about is student wellness, particularly with respect to mental health. I worked with, Emily, the Secretary of Health and Wellbeing this year on policy that aims to recognize mental health as an excusable reason for absence, with appropriate documentation. Our resolution passed the board unanimously and was referred to the Cal Poly President Armstrong as well as other campus officials.

### Fiduciary

Directors are also responsible for the internal corporate business like budget approvals and strategic planning.

This year, I was appointed to Co-Chair the Internal Review Committee. This is one of two corporate committees within ASI and it's role is more stipulated by mandates. Internal Review oversees risk management and serves as the corporation's audit committee.

In the fall, the Board of Directors approved an ad hoc committee to conduct a comprehensive bylaw review. I helped incorporate a nonprofit in 2022, which entailed writing some bylaws, so I was appointed to chair this committee as well.

The committee was composed of all three of the corporation's officers, plus three additional student leaders in student government. This meant six confident voices held a seat at the table and facilitating the discussion effectively would prove pertinent to our success. An unanticipated challenge, however, was push-back from other stakeholders. On a couple instances, I presented revisions made by the committee to the Board of Directors and wasn't quite prepared for the amount of feedback. It taught me a lesson about creating a comfortable buffer between myself and my work.

The final bill passed the Board of Directors unanimously and the revisions we instituted will carry into future administrations of ASI indefinitely.

## Recognition

This leads us to the end of the academic year. I advocated for policy serving the mental wellness of students and revamped our corporate bylaws. I continuously asked hard questions of campus officials and stood up to stakeholders of my work, to justify or modify our decisions.

Sarah Storelli, former ASI Student Body President, instituted the "Use Your Voice" Scholarship this year on behalf of her mom, Kathy Storelli. The Board of Directors had the privilege of hearing both Kathy and Sarah during speak during one of our recent meetings. They shared beautiful words and inspiring sentiment that spoke powerfully to student government members.

During our student government end-of-year banquet, I was awarded this scholarship and asked to give an impromptu speech. I am beyond grateful for the support and lessons that ASI has provided me. Student government lends me a platform to spark change on campus that reaches our entire student body. It's my mission to continue elevating student voices and maximizing my impact on campus. The Storelli family, students, and staff at ASI continue to motivate my work.
