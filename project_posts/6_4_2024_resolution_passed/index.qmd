## History

As an elected member of the ASI Board of Directors, I made it part of my 2023 campaign to advocate for mental wellness on the Cal Poly campus. Last fall, I reached out the Secretary of Campus Health and Well-being, Emily Prince, and we began authoring legislation that would drive this mission.\
\
It was in the midst of drafting our message and holding meetings with campus officials that the exigence of this work became clear to me. An individual who is very close to my heart faced a mental health crisis. I shed many tears, for many days, and my academics were impacted. This was beyond challenging, but the experience gave me new and ambitious passion for the work Emily and I were spearheading.\
\
Resolution 24-02 of the ASI Board of Directors called upon the university Academic Senate to include mental health in the definition of illness within the Excusable Absence Policy. On February 21st of this year, the Board passed our resolution unanimously. As the official voice of the student body, the position of ASI Student Government was made clear by this legislation, and it was promptly disseminated to University President Armstrong and a number of VP's at Cal Poly. The Academic Senate pushed the legislation forward and authored their own legislation that, if approved, would change the Excusable Absence Policy, consistent with our recommendations.

## Present

Today marked an important day for Cal Poly and the ASI Board of Directors. I am pleased to announce that the Academic Senate has now passed the policy, changing language on the Excusable Absence Policy to be explicitly inclusive of mental health and discouraging the requirement of a doctor's note. This is a huge leap forward for Cal Poly students and it is my honor to be at the forefront of this action.

I want to thank Emily Prince for your thoughtful collaboration and the Board of Directors for your passionate support. I also want to thank Dr. Greenwood for your guidance in this process. The Student Health Advisory Committee stood beside us and advised our legislation. Thank you to the members of SHAC as well. Lastly, thank you to everyone who provided feedback and insight on the resolution. Your voices were heard and I hope you feel proud of the work you helped to create.
