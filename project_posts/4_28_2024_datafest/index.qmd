## About

DataFest is a 48 hour data analysis marathon hosted by the American Statistical Association. Every year, undergraduates all across the United States are provided a large, rich, and complex data set. Students are tasked with wrangling and analyzing these data to present insights, as they work around the clock to prepare a five minute presentation for a panel of judges.

Students are prohibited from sharing detailed information about the data for confidentiality. This post is limited to my reflection on the experience.

## Clock Starts

### Explore

To kick-off the event, we were shown a video introducing the data set. The data were sectioned into multiple files and we started by delegating the files to each of the four members of our team. We first needed to orient ourselves with the data, read the documentation, and conduct exploratory analysis.

We allotted time for the team to come together and collectively discuss the highlights and interesting characteristics from each of our sets. We kept tabs on what kind of information each team member found so that we were able to strategically combine data sets later in the analysis. After discussing, we went our separate ways again and dove deeper into each of our preliminary ideas.

### Approach

This year at Cal Poly, I've applied a new approach to learning and asking questions. In the stats industry, we see our fair share of formulas. Many of my peers commit these formulas to memory and score very highly on exams. I wonder, though, the extent to which we can make claims about these students' material acquisition based on their exam scores. I am not so good at memorizing formulas and, instead, I began asking myself about the *story* that the course is telling. After all, intelligent and thoughtful academics design these courses, write our textbooks, and they do so with intent about the order and nature in which content is delivered. There's a subtle opportunity here for students to identify the course narrative and maybe enhance their understanding. I've started attending more office hours, asking my instructors to take me through the *narrative of the course* and answer some of the "why's" regarding the order and nature in which the material is taught. It's also a great way to look back on the term in preparation for final exams.

Looking back, I wish our team took more time at the beginning to think and share about potential stories that were emerging from the data.

## Roadblock

Half-way through the competition, our team was hitting roadblocks and was feeling unhopeful. Each of us was building a separate component of the presentation. I was focused on joining two data sets to extract a broader, philosophical claim about the data and my team was reasonably skeptical. The data wrangling was taking me longer than we anticipated and other analyses were appearing statistically insignificant or disjointed. After a walk around campus, we continued making periodic strides forward on the quantitative analysis.

My sub-project was finally bearing something useful. After I was finally able to arrange and clean the data appropriately, they were ready to be graphed. I paired up with another group member to help with creating a set of box plots with density curve overlays. The rest of our team worked on aesthetics, accessibility, and synthesizing some of their own quantitative findings to further drive the narrative. They built a beautiful presentation and we worked together on a script.

## Conclusion

We presented our findings to the panel and were hopeful that our visualization would impress the judges. And it did, indeed, as our team was awarded with Best Visualization. An exciting and challenging experience, DataFest provided us an opportunity to test our skills in a rapid succession of EDA, statistical analysis, story-boarding, and oral communication.

Chapter reflection score (EOC) is the response variable and reflection score is the explanatory variable. Each pane represents a psychological construct that the reflection score was measuring. These include cost, expectancy, intrinsic value, and utility value. The plots reveal and upward trend in EOC as the reflection score increased for all constructs except cost."}
